> Big data is like teenage sex: everyone talks about it, nobody really knows how to do it, everyone thinks everyone else is doing it, so everyone claims they are doing it...

> Although it is easier to find information these days, it is easier than ever before to find misinformation, pseudo-facts, unsupported and fringe opinions, and the like. Children should be taught at an early age what constitutes evidence, how to detect biases or distortions in newspaper accounts, and that there exist hierarchies of information sources.

Daniel J. Levitin - The Guardian - 18 Jan 2015


> First, and perhaps most important lesson, if you are going to try to use new data to revolutionize a field, it is best to go into a field where old methods are lousy.

> The second lesson is that, when trying to make predictions, you needn’t worry too much about why your models work.

> One is in the prediction business, not the explanation business. And, in the prediction business, you just need to know that something works, not why.
